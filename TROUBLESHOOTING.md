# 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide - UI Not Showing Issue

## Problem Identified ❌
The drawer and footer navigation were not showing in the UI.

## Root Cause 🔍
The component structure had a **circular rendering issue**:
- `RootLayout` was calling `TabLayout`
- `TabLayout` was trying to render `DrawerLayout`
- `DrawerLayout` was rendering `<Tabs>` component
- This created a nested structure that prevented proper rendering

## Solution Applied ✅

### Restructured Components
1. **Merged TabLayout and DrawerLayout** into a single `DrawerAndTabLayout` component
2. **Removed BlurView** from drawer (can cause rendering issues on some platforms)
3. **Simplified the component hierarchy**:
   ```
   RootLayout (GoldPriceProvider)
     └─ DrawerAndTabLayout
          ├─ SafeAreaView (container)
          ├─ Tabs (main content)
          ├─ Footer Navigation
          └─ Drawer Modal
   ```

### Key Changes Made

#### Before (Not Working):
```tsx
RootLayout → GoldPriceProvider → TabLayout → DrawerLayout → Tabs
```

#### After (Working):
```tsx
RootLayout → GoldPriceProvider → DrawerAndTabLayout → [Tabs + Footer + Drawer]
```

## What's Now Working ✨

### 1. **Header Bar**
- ☰ Menu button (left) - Opens drawer
- Logo + "Fancy Jewellers" (center)
- 👤 Profile button (right)

### 2. **Footer Navigation**
5 buttons always visible at bottom:
- 📈 Live Rate
- 🧮 Calculator
- 💎 **Jewellery** (featured/elevated)
- 🪙 Coins
- 👤 Profile

### 3. **Drawer Menu**
Slide-out navigation with 9 options:
- 🏠 Home
- 📊 Live Gold Rate
- 🧮 Gold Calculator
- 🪙 Gold Coins
- 💍 Jewellery Collection
- 👤 My Profile
- 🏦 Bank Details
- ℹ️ About Us
- 📞 Contact Us

## Testing Instructions 📱

### On Mobile/Emulator:
1. Run: `npx expo start`
2. Scan QR code or press 'a' for Android
3. Check:
   - ✅ Header shows menu, logo, and profile button
   - ✅ Footer shows 5 navigation buttons
   - ✅ Tap menu button to open drawer
   - ✅ All navigation works correctly

### On Web:
1. Run: `npx expo start --web`
2. Open: http://localhost:8081 (or 8082 if 8081 is busy)
3. Verify same functionality as mobile

## Common Issues & Fixes 🛠️

### Issue: "Port already in use"
**Solution**: Use the alternate port suggested by Expo (usually 8082)

### Issue: "BlurView not rendering"
**Solution**: Removed BlurView and using solid background with opacity

### Issue: "Drawer not opening"
**Solution**: Verify Modal is outside SafeAreaView and has proper z-index

### Issue: "Footer not showing"
**Solution**: Ensure SafeAreaView has edges={['bottom']} set

## Performance Tips ⚡

1. **Cache Clearing**: Run `npx expo start --clear` if UI updates don't appear
2. **Hot Reload**: Press 'r' in terminal to reload the app
3. **Full Restart**: Stop server (Ctrl+C) and restart if needed

## File Structure 📁

```
